- **Parent** (`parentname`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
The name of this entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Entities with parents move with their parent.

- **Parent Bone/Attachment Name** (`parentAttachmentName`) \<`ParentAttachment`\>\
The name of the bone or attachment to attach to on the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Use !bonemerge to use bone-merge style attachment. NOTE: If this is specified the Hammer transform will be disregarded, even if 'Use Local Transform' is NOT specified (in that case local transform will be identity)

- **Use Local Transform** (`useLocalOffset`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Whether to respect the specified local offset when doing the initial hierarchical attachment to its parent.

- **Local Origin** (`local.origin`) \<`Vector`\>\
Offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Local Angles** (`local.angles`) \<`Angle`\>\
Angular offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Local Scale** (`local.scales`) \<`Vector`\>\
Scale in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Brightness (1 - 255)** (`renderamt`) \<`Integer`\>

- **Beam Color (R G B)** (`rendercolor`) \<`Color255`\>

- **Radius** (`Radius`) \<`Integer`\>\
If the 'Random Strike' spawnflag is set, this radius determines the area within which the endpoints will randomly strike.

- **Life (seconds 0 = infinite)** (`life`) \<`String`\>\
Amount of time before the beam dies. Setting to zero will make the beam stay forever.

- **Width of beam** (`BoltWidth`) \<`Float`\>\
Pixel width of the beam.

- **Amount of noise (0-255)** (`NoiseAmplitude`) \<`Float`\>\
The amount of noise in the beam. 0 is a perfectly straight beam.

- **Sprite Name** (`texture`) \<`Sprite`\>\
The material used to draw the beam.

- **Texture Scroll Rate (0-100)** (`TextureScroll`) \<`Integer`\>\
Rate at which the beam texture should scroll along the beam.

- **Frames per 10 seconds** (`framerate`) \<`Integer`\>\
Framerate at which the beam texture should animate, if it has multiple frames.

- **Starting Frame** (`framestart`) \<`Integer`\>\
The frame to start the beam texture on.

- **Strike again time (secs)** (`StrikeTime`) \<`String`\>\
Refire time between random strikes of the beam. Only used if the 'Random Strike' spawnflag is set.

- **Damage / second** (`damage`) \<`String`\>\
How much damage this beam does per second to things it hits when it is continually on, or instantaneously if it strikes. For continuous damage, the value should be greater than 10 or it may not work.

- **Start Entity** (`LightningStart`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
Entity that the beam starts at.

- **Ending Entity** (`LightningEnd`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
Entity that the beam ends at.

- **Decal Name** (`decalname`) \<`String`\>\
Decal to be applied at the end of the beam

- **HDR color scale.** (`HDRColorScale`) \<`Float`\>\
float value to multiply sprite color by when running in HDR mode.

- **Endpoint handle** (`targetpoint`) \<`Vecline`\>\
If a LightningEnd entity is not specified, use this point as the destination instead. If the env_beam moves, the destination point will move along with it.

- **Spawnflags** (`spawnflags`) \<`Flags`\>
  - Start On 
  - Toggle 
  - Random Strike 
  - Ring 
  - StartSparks 
  - EndSparks 
  - Decal End 
  - Shade Start 
  - Shade End 
  - Taper Out 


- **Touch Type (tripwire)** (`TouchType`) \<`Choices`\>\
If you want the beam to fire an output when touched by entities, choose the entity type here.
  - Not a tripwire 
  - Player Only 
  - NPC Only 
  - Player or NPC 
  - Player or NPC or Physprop 


- **Beam clipping** (`ClipStyle`) \<`Choices`\>\
Select whether you want the beam to clip against geometry or characters
  - Do not clip (default) 
  - Clip to geometry 
  - Clip to everything solid 


- **Filter Name** (`filtername`) \<`FilterClass`\>\
Filter to use to see if activator triggers me. See filter_activator_name for more explanation.
