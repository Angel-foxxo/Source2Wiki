Mesh Entity

An entity used to trigger something when the player looks at something. It fires 'OnTrigger' when the player looks at a target entity for the given amount of time, while within the trigger volume. If the player leaves the trigger or looks away from the target entity the clock resets. If the 'Use Velocity instead of facing' spawnflag is checked, the trigger uses the player's velocity instead of the player's view, so it determines whenever the player is moving toward the target entity. Useful for triggering when players are driving a vehicle at something.NOTE: Only designed for single-player game.

<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Global Entity Name** (`globalname`) \<`String`\>\
Name by which this entity is linked to another entity in a different map. When the player transitions to a new map, entities in the new map with globalnames matching entities in the previous map will have the previous map's state copied over their state.

- **Spawnflags** (`spawnflags`) \<`Flags`\>
  - Clients
  - NPCs
  - Pushables
  - Physics Objects
  - Only player ally NPCs
  - Only clients in vehicles
  - Everything (not including physics debris)
  - Only clients *not* in vehicles
  - Physics debris
  - Only NPCs in vehicles (respects player ally flag)
  - Correctly account for object mass (trigger_push used to assume 100Kg) and multiple component physobjs (car, blob...)
  - Ignore client's hands


- **Filter Name** (`filtername`) \<`FilterClass`\>\
Filter to use to see if activator triggers me. See filter_activator_name for more explanation.

- **Start Disabled** (`StartDisabled`) \<`Boolean`\>

- **Parent** (`parentname`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
The name of this entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Entities with parents move with their parent.

- **Parent Model Bone/Attachment Name** (`parentAttachmentName`) \<`ParentAttachment`\>\
The name of the bone or attachment to attach to on the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Use !bonemerge to use bone-merge style attachment.

- **Model Attachment position offset** (`local.origin`) \<`Vector`\>\
Offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Model Attachment angular offset** (`local.angles`) \<`Angle`\>\
Angular offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Model Attachment scale** (`local.scales`) \<`Vector`\>\
Scale in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Use Model Attachment Offset** (`useLocalOffset`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Whether to respect the specified local offset when doing the initial hierarchical attachment to its parent.

- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Spawnflags** (`spawnflags`) \<`Flags`\>
  - Fire Once
  - Use Velocity instead of facing


- **Look Target** (`target`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
The name of the entity to be looked at.

- **Look Time** (`LookTime`) \<`String`\>\
The time, in seconds, that the player must look the target before firing the output. Resets if player leaves trigger, or looks outside the Field of View threshold.

- **Field Of View** (`FieldOfView`) \<`String`\>\
How close the player has to be looking at the target.

 1.0 = straight ahead
 0.0 = +/- 90 degrees
 -1.0 = all directions

- **Use 2D Field Of View** (`FOV2D`) \<`Boolean`\>\
In 2D mode the look angle FOV is only checked along the x and y axes, not the z.

- **Timeout** (`Timeout`) \<`Float`\>\
The time, in seconds, to wait after player enters the trigger before firing the OnTimeout output, 0 = never. NOTE: When the timeout expires, the OnTrigger output does NOT fire!

- **Test occlusion** (`test_occlusion`) \<`Boolean`\>\
If set, player must have clear LOS to the target (ignoring dynamic entities).

Disable this entity.

- SetParent \<`TargetDestination`\>\
Changes the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy.

- SetParentAttachment \<`String`\>\
Change this entity to attach to a specific attachment point on its parent. Entities must be parented before being sent this input. The parameter passed in should be the name of the attachment.

- SetParentAttachmentMaintainOffset \<`String`\>\

Calls a script function in the global script scope.

- Kill \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity from the world.

- KillHierarchy \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity and all its children from the world.

- AddOutput \<`String`\>\
Adds an entity I/O connection to this entity. Parameter format: outputname&gt;targetname>inputname&gt;parameter&gt;delay&gt;max times to fire (-1 == infinite). Very dangerous, use with care.
