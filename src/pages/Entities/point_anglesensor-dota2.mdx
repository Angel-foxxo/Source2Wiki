<details open>
<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Start Disabled** (`StartDisabled`) \<`Boolean`\>

- **Parent** (`parentname`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
The name of this entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Entities with parents move with their parent.

- **Parent Bone/Attachment Name** (`parentAttachmentName`) \<`ParentAttachment`\>\
The name of the bone or attachment to attach to on the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Use !bonemerge to use bone-merge style attachment. NOTE: If this is specified the Hammer transform will be disregarded, even if 'Use Local Transform' is NOT specified (in that case local transform will be identity)

- **Use Local Transform** (`useLocalOffset`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Whether to respect the specified local offset when doing the initial hierarchical attachment to its parent.

- **Local Origin** (`local.origin`) \<`Vector`\>\
Offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Local Angles** (`local.angles`) \<`Angle`\>\
Angular offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Local Scale** (`local.scales`) \<`Vector`\>\
Scale in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Target Entity Name** (`target`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
Name of the entity whose angles will be sensed.

- **Look At Entity** (`lookatname`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
The entity we want to check to see if the Target Entity is looking at.

- **Duration** (`duration`) \<`Float`\>\
The amount of time the Target Entity must look at the 'Look at Entity' to trigger this entity, in seconds.

- **Tolerance** (`tolerance`) \<`Integer`\>\
The tolerance, in degrees, in the checking to determine when the Target Entity is looking at the Look At Entity.

- **Spawnflags** (`spawnflags`) \<`Flags`\>
  - Use target entity's angles (NOT position)

<summary><h2>Inputs</h2></summary>
- Enable \<`Void`\>\
Enable this entity.

- Disable \<`Void`\>\
Disable this entity.

- SetParent \<`TargetDestination`\>\
Changes the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy.

- SetParentAttachment \<`String`\>\
Change this entity to attach to a specific attachment point on its parent. Entities must be parented before being sent this input. The parameter passed in should be the name of the attachment.

- SetParentAttachmentMaintainOffset \<`String`\>\
Change this entity to attach to a specific attachment point on it's parent. Entities must be parented before being sent this input. The parameter passed in should be the name of the attachment. The entity will maintain it's position relative to the parent at the time it is attached.

- ClearParent \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity from the the movement hierarchy, leaving it free to move independently.

- FollowEntity \<`String`\>\
Bone merges this entity to a parent entity. Call again passing nothing to end the bone merge.

- RunScriptFile \<`String`\>\
Load and execute a script file

- RunScriptCode \<`String`\>\
Execute a fragment of script code

- CallScriptFunction \<`String`\>\
Call a script function

- CallPrivateScriptFunction \<`String`\>\
Calls a script function from this entity's private script scope.

- CallGlobalScriptFunction \<`String`\>\
Calls a script function in the global script scope.

- Kill \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity from the world.

- KillHierarchy \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity and all its children from the world.

- KillConstrained \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity, all its children, and anything constrained to it, from the world.

- AddOutput \<`String`\>\
Adds an entity I/O connection to this entity. Parameter format: outputname&gt;targetname>inputname&gt;parameter&gt;delay&gt;max times to fire (-1 == infinite). Very dangerous, use with care.

- FireUser1 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser1 output to be fired.

- FireUser2 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser2 output to be fired.

- FireUser3 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser3 output to be fired.

- FireUser4 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser4 output to be fired.

- Toggle \<`Void`\>\
Toggle the sensor between enabled and disabled.

- Test \<`Void`\>\
Check to see if the Target Entity is facing the Look At Entity within the specified tolerance, firing either the OnFacingLookat or OnNotFacingLookat output based on the result.

<summary><h2>Outputs</h2></summary>
- OnUser1 \<`Void`\>\
Fired in response to FireUser1 input.

- OnUser2 \<`Void`\>\
Fired in response to FireUser2 input.

- OnUser3 \<`Void`\>\
Fired in response to FireUser3 input.

- OnUser4 \<`Void`\>\
Fired in response to FireUser4 input.

- OnKilled \<`Void`\>\
Fired when the entity is killed and removed from the game. Parameter is the inflictor.

- TargetDir \<`Vector`\>\
Fired when the forward direction of the Target Entity changes. Passes the new forward direction as a parameter.

- OnFacingLookat \<`Void`\>\
Fired when the Target Entity points at the Look At Entity for more than the specified Duration, or in response to a Test input.

- OnNotFacingLookat \<`Void`\>\
Fires in response to a Test input when the Target Entity is not pointing at the Look At Entity.

- FacingPercentage \<`Float`\>\
Normalized value (0..1) where 1 is facing directly at target and 0 is at or beyond the angle of tolerance.
