- **Disable X360** (`disableX360`) \<`Choices`\>
  - No
  - Yes


- **World Model** (`model`) \<`Studio`\>

- **Skin** (`skin`) \<`MaterialGroup`\>\
Some models have multiple versions of their textures, called skins.

- **Collisions** (`solid`) \<`Choices`\>
  - Not Solid
  - Use axis-aligned box
  - Use oriented Box
  - Use VPhysics


- **Disable Shadows** (`disableshadows`) \<`Boolean`\>

- **Start Fade Dist/Pixels** (`fademindist`) \<`Float`\>\
Distance at which the prop starts to fade (&lt;0 = subtract from fademaxdist).

- **End Fade Dist/Pixels** (`fademaxdist`) \<`Float`\>\
Maximum distance at which the prop is visible (0 = don't fade out).

- **Fade Scale** (`fadescale`) \<`Float`\>\
If you specify a fade in the worldspawn, or if the engine is running under low end/medium end/XBox360, then the engine will forcibly fade out props even if fademindist/fademaxdist isn't specified. This scale factor gives you some control over the fade. Using 0 here turns off the forcible fades. Numbers smaller than 1 cause the prop to fade out at further distances, and greater than 1 cause it to fade out at closer distances.

- **Detail Geometry** (`detailgeometry`) \<`Boolean`\>\
If true this geometry is not important for precomputed lighting
