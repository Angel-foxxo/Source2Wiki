Mesh Entity

An entity that works as a rotating/moving platform that will carry a train to a new track. It must be larger in X-Y planar area than the train, since it must contain the train within these dimensions in order to operate when the train is near it.

  - Yes\
    
  - Bounce Only\
    


- **Parent** (`parentname`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
The name of this entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Entities with parents move with their parent.

- **Parent Model Bone/Attachment Name** (`parentAttachmentName`) \<`ParentAttachment`\>\
The name of the bone or attachment to attach to on the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Use !bonemerge to use bone-merge style attachment.

- **Model Attachment position offset** (`local.origin`) \<`Vector`\>\
Offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Model Attachment angular offset** (`local.angles`) \<`Angle`\>\
Angular offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Model Attachment scale** (`local.scales`) \<`Vector`\>\

Whether to respect the specified local offset when doing the initial hierarchical attachment to its parent.

- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.
