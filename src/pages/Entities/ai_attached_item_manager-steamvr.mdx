AI Attached Item Manager - manages the items attached to one or more NPCs / ragdolls.

<details open>
<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Target(s)** (`target`) \<`TargetNameOrClass`\>\
This is the NPC(s) who's items this manager should be managing. May be a targetname or a classname.

- **Number of Attached Items** (`num_attached_items`) \<`Integer`\>\
The number of items attached to our target NPC(s). The NPC(s) will also need a matching number of attachment points on their model.

- **Item 1** (`item_1`) \<`String`\>\
Classname of item to attach in slot 1. If left empty, the NPC's default item code will decide what it should be, if anything.

- **Item 2** (`item_2`) \<`String`\>\
Classname of item to attach in slot 2. If left empty, the NPC's default item code will decide what it should be, if anything.

- **Item 3** (`item_3`) \<`String`\>\
Classname of item to attach in slot 3. If left empty, the NPC's default item code will decide what it should be, if anything.

- **Item 4** (`item_4`) \<`String`\>\
Classname of item to attach in slot 4. If left empty, the NPC's default item code will decide what it should be, if anything.

- **Listen to Entity Spawns** (`listen_entityspawns`) \<`Boolean`\>\
If you want this manager to affect valid targets that are spawned after the manager, you need to set this. Most likely only needed if you want to target NPCs via a classname to catch all future spawns on that NPC type. It has a perf cost, so don't turn it on if you don't need it.

- **Item Removal Allowed for Ammo Balancing** (`mark_as_removable`) \<`Choices`\>
  - No\
    
  - Yes\
