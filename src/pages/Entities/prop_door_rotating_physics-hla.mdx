<details open>
<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Minimum Sound Velocity** (`minSoundThreshold`) \<`Float`\>\
When travelling below this many units/sec, will not play any sound.

- **Full Sound Velocity** (`maxSoundThreshold`) \<`Float`\>\
When travelling at this speed or above, will play sound at full volume.

- **Travel sound (forward)** (`slidesoundfwd`) \<`Sound`\>\
Play this sound when travelling forward on helper axis

- **Travel sound (backward)** (`slidesoundback`) \<`Sound`\>\
Play this sound when travelling backward on helper axis

- **Reversal sound threshold (small)** (`reversalsoundthresholdSmall`) \<`Float`\>\
When accelerating by more than this many units/sec^2 opposite to direction of travel, play the small reversal sound.

- **Reversal sound threshold (medium)** (`reversalsoundthresholdMedium`) \<`Float`\>\
When accelerating by more than this many units/sec^2 opposite to direction of travel, play the medium reversal sound.

- **Reversal sound threshold (large)** (`reversalsoundthresholdLarge`) \<`Float`\>\
When accelerating by more than this many units/sec^2 opposite to direction of travel, play the large reversal sound.

- **Reversal sound (small)** (`reversalsoundSmall`) \<`Sound`\>\
Play this sound when making a hard reverse over the small threshold but less than medium

- **Reversal sound (medium)** (`reversalsoundMedium`) \<`Sound`\>\
Play this sound when making a hard reverse over the medium threshold but less than large

- **Reversal sound (large)** (`reversalsoundLarge`) \<`Sound`\>\
Play this sound when making a hard reverse over the large threshold

- **Glow State** (`glowstate`) \<`Choices`\>
  - OFF
  - +use
  - look-at
  - ON


- **Glow Range** (`glowrange`) \<`Integer`\>\
Range at which the glow becomes visible. (0 = always visible)

- **Glow Range Min** (`glowrangemin`) \<`Integer`\>\
Range at which the glow stops being visible. (0 = always visible)

- **Glow Color Override (R G B)** (`glowcolor`) \<`Color255`\>\
Change the render color of the glow.

- **Start Fade Dist** (`fademindist`) \<`Float`\>\
Distance at which the prop starts to fade (&lt;0 = subtract from fademaxdist).

- **End Fade Dist** (`fademaxdist`) \<`Float`\>\
Max fade distance at which the prop is visible (0 = don't fade out)

- **Fade Scale** (`fadescale`) \<`Float`\>\
If you specify a fade in the worldspawn, or if the engine is running under low end/medium end/XBox360, then the engine will forcibly fade out props even if fademindist/fademaxdist isn't specified. This scale factor gives you some control over the fade. Using 0 here turns off the forcible fades. Numbers smaller than 1 cause the prop to fade out at further distances, and greater than 1 cause it to fade out at closer distances.
