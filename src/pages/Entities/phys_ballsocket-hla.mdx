Point Entity

A constraint that keeps the position of two objects fixed, relative to the constraint's origin. It does not affect rotation.

<details open>
<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Spawnflags** (`spawnflags`) \<`Flags`\>
  - No Collision until break\
    
  - Start inactive\
    
  - Change mass to keep stable attachment to world\
    
  - Do not connect entities until turned on\
    


- **Entity 1** (`attach1`) \<`TargetDestination`\>

- **Entity 2** (`attach2`) \<`TargetDestination`\>

- **Impulse Limit to Break (kg)** (`forcelimit`) \<`Float`\>\
The amount of impulse an impact must apply to the constraint to break it. A way of calculating this is to set it to the mass of an object that would break this constraint if it were resting on the constrainted objects.

- **Angular Impulse Limit to Break (kg * distance)** (`torquelimit`) \<`Float`\>\
The amount of angular impulse required to break the constraint. A way of calculating this is to multiply any reference mass by the resting distance (from the center of mass of the object) needed to break the constraint.

- **Play Sound on Break** (`breaksound`) \<`Sound`\>\
A sound played when the constraint is broken.

- **Follow teleport distance** (`teleportfollowdistance`) \<`Float`\>\
If one object teleports more than this many units away it will cause the other constrained object to teleport to an appropriate relative position.

- **Spawnflags** (`spawnflags`) \<`Flags`\>

- **Friction** (`friction`) \<`Float`\>\
Resistance/friction in the constraint

<summary><h2>Inputs</h2></summary>
- RunScriptFile \<`String`\>\
Load and execute a script file

- RunScriptCode \<`String`\>\
Execute a fragment of script code

- CallScriptFunction \<`String`\>\
Call a script function

- CallPrivateScriptFunction \<`String`\>\
Calls a script function from this entity's private script scope.

- CallGlobalScriptFunction \<`String`\>\
Calls a script function in the global script scope.

- Kill \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity from the world.

- KillHierarchy \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity and all its children from the world.

- AddOutput \<`String`\>\
Adds an entity I/O connection to this entity. Parameter format: outputname&gt;targetname>inputname&gt;parameter&gt;delay&gt;max times to fire (-1 == infinite). Very dangerous, use with care.

- FireUser1 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser1 output to be fired.

- FireUser2 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser2 output to be fired.

- FireUser3 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser3 output to be fired.

- FireUser4 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser4 output to be fired.

- Break \<`Void`\>\
Force the constraint to break.

- TurnOn \<`Void`\>\
Enable the constraint.  Do this when the objects don't exist when the constraint spawns - or when you have deactivated the constraint.  Broken constraints can NOT be turned on.  They have been deleted.

- TurnOff \<`Void`\>\
Disable this constraint.
