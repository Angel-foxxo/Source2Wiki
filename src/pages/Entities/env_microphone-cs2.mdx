Point Entity

An entity that acts as a microphone. It works in one of two modes. If it has a 'Speaker' set, it picks up all sounds within the specified sound range, and rebroadcasts them through the Speaker entity. In this Speaker mode, it ignores the Hears X spawnflags and does not fire the SoundLevel output. If it has no Speaker set, it measures the sound level at a point, and outputs the sound level as a value between 0 and 1. In Measuring mode, it only hears sounds that match the Hear X spawnflags.

<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Start Disabled** (`StartDisabled`) \<`Boolean`\>

- **Parent** (`parentname`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
The name of this entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Entities with parents move with their parent.

- **Parent Model Bone/Attachment Name** (`parentAttachmentName`) \<`ParentAttachment`\>\
The name of the bone or attachment to attach to on the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Use !bonemerge to use bone-merge style attachment.

- **Model Attachment position offset** (`local.origin`) \<`Vector`\>\
Offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Model Attachment angular offset** (`local.angles`) \<`Angle`\>\
Angular offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Model Attachment scale** (`local.scales`) \<`Vector`\>\
Scale in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Use Model Attachment Offset** (`useLocalOffset`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Whether to respect the specified local offset when doing the initial hierarchical attachment to its parent.

- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Measure target** (`target`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
If the speaker is in Measuring mode, this is the name of the entity where the sound level is to be measured.

- **Speaker target** (`SpeakerName`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
The name of an info_target entity through which to play any sounds heard by this microphone. If specified, the microphone will consider itself in Speaker mode.

- **Listen Filter** (`ListenFilter`) \<`FilterClass`\>\
The name of an filter entity which specifies the only entities the microphone can hear. Sounds emitted by other entities will not be heard.

- **Speaker DSP Preset** (`speaker_dsp_preset`) \<`Choices`\>\
Only useful in Speaker mode. If specified, when the microphone is enabled, it'll set the global dsp_speaker preset to this value. Sounds played back through speakers will then be affected by the selected DSP.
  - Use Default\
    
  - 1 NO EFFECT\
    
  - 2 (DUPLICATE OF 1)\
    
  - 3 (DUPLICATE OF 1)\
    
  - 4 (DUPLICATE OF 1)\
    
  - 5 (DUPLICATE OF 1)\
    
  - 6 SPEAKER, LOUDER\
    
  - 7 SPEAKER VERY SMALL\
    
  - 8 LOUDSPEAKER, ECHO\
    
  - 9 SPEAKER SMALL\
    
  - 10 SPEAKER TINY\
    


- **Spawnflags** (`spawnflags`) \<`Flags`\>
  - Swallows sounds routed through speakers\
    
  - Hears explosions\
    
  - Ignores non-attenuated sounds\
    


- **Listen For Sound Type** (`SoundType`) \<`Choices`\>
  - Combat\
    
  - Player\
    
  - Danger\
    
  - Bullet Impacts\
    


- **Sensitivity (0 - 10)** (`Sensitivity`) \<`Float`\>\
Microphone sensitivity, 0=deaf, 1=default, 10=extremely sensitive). Only applicable in Measuring mode.

- **Smoothing (0 - 1)** (`SmoothFactor`) \<`Float`\>\
Smoothing factor, 0=no smoothing, 1=maximum smoothing). Only applicable in Measuring mode.

- **Maximum hearing range (0=infinite)** (`MaxRange`) \<`Float`\>\
Sounds beyond this range won't be heard, irrelevant of attenuation. WARNING: setting this to zero (or a value &gt; 1024) when the microphone is in Speaker mode can be very bad for performance!!

<summary><h2>Inputs</h2></summary>
- Enable \<`Void`\>\
Enable this entity.

- Disable \<`Void`\>\
Disable this entity.

- SetParent \<`TargetDestination`\>\
Changes the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy.

- SetParentAttachment \<`String`\>\
Change this entity to attach to a specific attachment point on its parent. Entities must be parented before being sent this input. The parameter passed in should be the name of the attachment.

- SetParentAttachmentMaintainOffset \<`String`\>\
Change this entity to attach to a specific attachment point on it's parent. Entities must be parented before being sent this input. The parameter passed in should be the name of the attachment. The entity will maintain it's position relative to the parent at the time it is attached.

- ClearParent \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity from the the movement hierarchy, leaving it free to move independently.

- FollowEntity \<`String`\>\
Bone merges this entity to a parent entity. Call again passing nothing to end the bone merge.
