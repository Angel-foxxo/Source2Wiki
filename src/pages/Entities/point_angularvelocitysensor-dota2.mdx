Point Entity

An entity that detects if another entity's angular velocity meets or exceeds a threshold value.

<details open>
<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Target Entity Name** (`target`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
Name of the entity whose angular velocity will be sensed.

- **Threshold Velocity** (`threshold`) \<`Float`\>\
The threshold angular velocity to compare against, in degrees per second.

- **Fire Interval** (`fireinterval`) \<`Float`\>\
Angular velocity must cross the threshold for at least this long to fire.

- **Axis** (`axis`) \<`Vecline`\>

- **Use Axis Helper** (`usehelper`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Use axis helper to determine rotation values (clockwise/counter-clockwise).

<summary><h2>Inputs</h2></summary>
- RunScriptFile \<`String`\>\
Load and execute a script file

- RunScriptCode \<`String`\>\
Execute a fragment of script code

- CallScriptFunction \<`String`\>\
Call a script function

- CallPrivateScriptFunction \<`String`\>\
Calls a script function from this entity's private script scope.

- CallGlobalScriptFunction \<`String`\>\
Calls a script function in the global script scope.

- Kill \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity from the world.

- KillHierarchy \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity and all its children from the world.

- KillConstrained \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity, all its children, and anything constrained to it, from the world.

- AddOutput \<`String`\>\
Adds an entity I/O connection to this entity. Parameter format: outputname&gt;targetname>inputname&gt;parameter&gt;delay&gt;max times to fire (-1 == infinite). Very dangerous, use with care.

- FireUser1 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser1 output to be fired.

- FireUser2 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser2 output to be fired.

- FireUser3 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser3 output to be fired.

- FireUser4 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser4 output to be fired.

- Test \<`Void`\>\
Checks to see if the Target Entity's angular velocity meets or exceeds the Threshold Velocity, firing either the OnGreaterThanOrEqualTo or OnLessThan output based on the result.

- TestWithInterval \<`Void`\>\
Checks to see if the Target Entity's angular velocity meets or exceeds the Threshold Velocity. Once the Fire Interval expires, fires the appropriate test result output if the result is stable throughout the Fire Interval.

<summary><h2>Outputs</h2></summary>
- OnUser1 \<`Void`\>\
Fired in response to FireUser1 input.

- OnUser2 \<`Void`\>\
Fired in response to FireUser2 input.

- OnUser3 \<`Void`\>\
Fired in response to FireUser3 input.

- OnUser4 \<`Void`\>\
Fired in response to FireUser4 input.

- OnKilled \<`Void`\>\
Fired when the entity is killed and removed from the game. Parameter is the inflictor.

- AngularVelocity \<`Float`\>\
Fired when the Target's Angular Velocity changes, passing the new magnitude of the angular velocity.

- OnGreaterThan \<`Void`\>\
Fired when the Target Entity goes from slower than the threshold angular velocity to faster than the threshold angular velocity.

- OnGreaterThanOrEqualTo \<`Void`\>\
Fired when the Target Entity goes from slower than the threshold angular velocity to faster than the threshold angular velocity.

- OnLessThan \<`Void`\>\
Fired when the Target Entity goes from faster than the threshold angular velocity to slower than the threshold angular velocity.

- OnLessThanOrEqualTo \<`Void`\>\
Fired when the Target Entity goes from faster than the threshold angular velocity to slower than the threshold angular velocity.

- OnEqualTo \<`Void`\>\
Fired when the Target Entity reaches the threshold angular velocity from a different velocity.
