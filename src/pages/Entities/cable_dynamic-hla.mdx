- **FX Amount (0 - 255)** (`renderamt`) \<`Integer`\>\
The FX amount is used by the selected Render Mode.

- **FX Color (R G B)** (`rendercolor`) \<`Color255`\>\
The FX color is used by the selected Render Mode.

- **Disable Receiving Shadows** (`disablereceiveshadows`) \<`Boolean`\>

- **Light Group** (`lightgroup`) \<`String`\>\
Will only be lit by lights affecting this group.

- **Start Fade Dist** (`fademindist`) \<`Float`\>\
Distance at which the overlay starts to fade (&lt;0 = subtract from fademaxdist).

- **End Fade Dist** (`fademaxdist`) \<`Float`\>\
Maximum distance at which the overlay is visible (0 = don't fade out).

- **Fade Scale** (`fadescale`) \<`Float`\>\
If you specify a fade in the worldspawn, or if the engine is running under low end/medium end/XBox360, then the engine will forcibly fade out props even if fademindist/fademaxdist isn't specified. This scale factor gives you some control over the fade. Using 0 here turns off the forcible fades. Numbers smaller than 1 cause the prop to fade out at further distances, and greater than 1 cause it to fade out at closer distances.

- **Render to Cubemaps** (`rendertocubemaps`) \<`Boolean`\>\
If true, this geometry renders into baked cube maps

- **Lightmap Static** (`lightmapstatic`) \<`Choices`\>\
How this geometry influences baked lighting.
  - No\
    
  - Yes\
    
  - Bounce Only\
    


- **Global Entity Name** (`globalname`) \<`String`\>\
Name by which this entity is linked to another entity in a different map. When the player transitions to a new map, entities in the new map with globalnames matching entities in the previous map will have the previous map's state copied over their state.

- **Parent** (`parentname`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
The name of this entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Entities with parents move with their parent.

- **Parent Model Bone/Attachment Name** (`parentAttachmentName`) \<`ParentAttachment`\>\
The name of the bone or attachment to attach to on the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Use !bonemerge to use bone-merge style attachment.

- **Model Attachment position offset** (`local.origin`) \<`Vector`\>\
Offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Model Attachment angular offset** (`local.angles`) \<`Angle`\>\
Angular offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Model Attachment scale** (`local.scales`) \<`Vector`\>\
Scale in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Use Model Attachment Offset** (`useLocalOffset`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Whether to respect the specified local offset when doing the initial hierarchical attachment to its parent.

- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Secondary Material** (`secondary_material`) \<`Material`\>\
Optional secondary material, can be selected using Skin(1)

- **Lighting Origin** (`lightingorigin`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
Select an entity to specify a location to sample lighting from, instead of using this entity's origin.

- **Disable Shadows** (`disableshadows`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Used to disable dynamic shadows on this entity.
