Point Entity

A constraint that constrains an entity along a line segment.

<details open>
<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Minimum Sound Velocity** (`minSoundThreshold`) \<`Float`\>\
When travelling below this many units/sec, will not play any sound.

- **Full Sound Velocity** (`maxSoundThreshold`) \<`Float`\>\
When travelling at this speed or above, will play sound at full volume.

- **Travel sound (forward)** (`slidesoundfwd`) \<`Sound`\>\
Play this sound when travelling forward on helper axis

- **Travel sound (backward)** (`slidesoundback`) \<`Sound`\>\
Play this sound when travelling backward on helper axis

- **Reversal sound threshold (small)** (`reversalsoundthresholdSmall`) \<`Float`\>\
When accelerating by more than this many units/sec^2 opposite to direction of travel, play the small reversal sound.

- **Reversal sound threshold (medium)** (`reversalsoundthresholdMedium`) \<`Float`\>\
When accelerating by more than this many units/sec^2 opposite to direction of travel, play the medium reversal sound.

- **Reversal sound threshold (large)** (`reversalsoundthresholdLarge`) \<`Float`\>\
When accelerating by more than this many units/sec^2 opposite to direction of travel, play the large reversal sound.

- **Reversal sound (small)** (`reversalsoundSmall`) \<`Sound`\>\
Play this sound when making a hard reverse over the small threshold but less than medium

- **Reversal sound (medium)** (`reversalsoundMedium`) \<`Sound`\>\
Play this sound when making a hard reverse over the medium threshold but less than large

- **Reversal sound (large)** (`reversalsoundLarge`) \<`Sound`\>\
Play this sound when making a hard reverse over the large threshold

- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Spawnflags** (`spawnflags`) \<`Flags`\>
  - No Collision until break
  - Start inactive
  - Change mass to keep stable attachment to world
  - Do not connect entities until turned on


- **Entity 1** (`attach1`) \<`TargetDestination`\>

- **Entity 2** (`attach2`) \<`TargetDestination`\>

- **Impulse Limit to Break (kg)** (`forcelimit`) \<`Float`\>\
The amount of impulse an impact must apply to the constraint to break it. A way of calculating this is to set it to the mass of an object that would break this constraint if it were resting on the constrainted objects.

- **Angular Impulse Limit to Break (kg * distance)** (`torquelimit`) \<`Float`\>\
The amount of angular impulse required to break the constraint. A way of calculating this is to multiply any reference mass by the resting distance (from the center of mass of the object) needed to break the constraint.

- **Play Sound on Break** (`breaksound`) \<`Sound`\>\
A sound played when the constraint is broken.

- **Follow teleport distance** (`teleportfollowdistance`) \<`Float`\>\
If one object teleports more than this many units away it will cause the other constrained object to teleport to an appropriate relative position.

- **Spawnflags** (`spawnflags`) \<`Flags`\>
  - No Collision until break
  - Limit Endpoints


- **Sliding Axis** (`slideaxis`) \<`Vecline`\>

- **Set motor friction, 0 = no friction, 1 = friction that is about enough to counter gravity** (`slidefriction`) \<`Float`\>

- **Load Scale** (`SystemLoadScale`) \<`Float`\>\
Scale of the mass load connected to this constraint (1=just the objects directly connected)

- **Initial Offset** (`initialoffset`) \<`Float`\>\
Initial offset in the range from -1 to 1 where -1 means spawn at the min limit, 0 means apply no offset, and 1 means spawn at max limit

- **Enable Linear Constraint** (`enablelinearconstraint`) \<`Boolean`\>

- **Enable Angular Constraint** (`enableangularconstraint`) \<`Boolean`\>

- **Motor frequency** (`motorfrequency`) \<`Float`\>\
Range 0 - 30 (only used when driving the relative offset through the offset input)

- **Motor damping ratio** (`motordampingratio`) \<`Float`\>\
Range 0 - 1 (only used when driving the relative offset through the offset input)

- **Motor max force** (`motormaxforcemultiplier`) \<`Float`\>\
Measured in multiples (e.g. 10x) of the mass where zero means NO limit (only used when driving the relative offset through the offset input)

- **Force Pivot** (`useEntityPivot`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Force joint position as constraint pivot

<summary><h2>Inputs</h2></summary>
- RunScriptFile \<`String`\>\
Load and execute a script file

- RunScriptCode \<`String`\>\
Execute a fragment of script code

- CallScriptFunction \<`String`\>\
Call a script function

- CallPrivateScriptFunction \<`String`\>\
Calls a script function from this entity's private script scope.

- CallGlobalScriptFunction \<`String`\>\
Calls a script function in the global script scope.

- Kill \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity from the world.

- KillHierarchy \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity and all its children from the world.

- KillConstrained \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity, all its children, and anything constrained to it, from the world.

- AddOutput \<`String`\>\
Adds an entity I/O connection to this entity. Parameter format: outputname&gt;targetname>inputname&gt;parameter&gt;delay&gt;max times to fire (-1 == infinite). Very dangerous, use with care.

- FireUser1 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser1 output to be fired.

- FireUser2 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser2 output to be fired.

- FireUser3 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser3 output to be fired.

- FireUser4 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser4 output to be fired.

- Break \<`Void`\>\
Force the constraint to break.

- TurnOn \<`Void`\>\
Enable the constraint.  Do this when the objects don't exist when the constraint spawns - or when you have deactivated the constraint.  Broken constraints can NOT be turned on.  They have been deleted.

- TurnOff \<`Void`\>\
Disable this constraint.

- SetOffset \<`Float`\>\
Normalized input to drive along the slide axis. E.g 0 = min limit and 1 = max limit

- SetVelocity \<`Float`\>\
Set linear velocity along the constraint

- SetSlideFriction \<`Float`\>\
Set motor friction, 0 = no friction, 1 = friction that is about enough to counter gravity
