<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Global Entity Name** (`globalname`) \<`String`\>\

  - Clients
  - NPCs
  - Pushables
  - Physics Objects
  - Only player ally NPCs
  - Only clients in vehicles
  - Everything (not including physics debris)
  - Only clients *not* in vehicles
  - Physics debris
  - Only NPCs in vehicles (respects player ally flag)
  - Correctly account for object mass (trigger_push used to assume 100Kg) and multiple component physobjs (car, blob...)
  - Ignore client's hands


- **Filter Name** (`filtername`) \<`FilterClass`\>\
Filter to use to see if activator triggers me. See filter_activator_name for more explanation.

- **Start Disabled** (`StartDisabled`) \<`Boolean`\>

- **Parent** (`parentname`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
The name of this entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Entities with parents move with their parent.

- **Parent Model Bone/Attachment Name** (`parentAttachmentName`) \<`ParentAttachment`\>\
The name of the bone or attachment to attach to on the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Use !bonemerge to use bone-merge style attachment.

- **Model Attachment position offset** (`local.origin`) \<`Vector`\>\
Offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Model Attachment angular offset** (`local.angles`) \<`Angle`\>\
Angular offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Model Attachment scale** (`local.scales`) \<`Vector`\>\
Scale in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Use Model Attachment Offset** (`useLocalOffset`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Whether to respect the specified local offset when doing the initial hierarchical attachment to its parent.

- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Master (Obsolete)** (`master`) \<`String`\>\
Legacy support: The name of a master entity. If the master hasn't been activated, this entity will not activate.

- **Damage** (`damage`) \<`Integer`\>\
The amount of damage done to entities that touch this trigger. The damage is done every half-second. See also 'Damage Model' for extra details on how damage can be dealt.

- **Damage Cap** (`damagecap`) \<`Integer`\>\
Maximum damage dealt per second. This field is only used if you select the Doubling w/Forgiveness damage model, via the spawnflag.

- **Damage Type** (`damagetype`) \<`Choices`\>

- **Damage Model** (`damagemodel`) \<`Choices`\>\
How damage is dealt. Normal always does the specified amount of damage each half second. Doubling starts with the specified amount and doubles it each time it hurts the toucher. Forgiveness means that if the toucher gets out of the trigger the damage will reset to the specified value. Good for making triggers that are deadly over time without having to cause massive damage on each touch.
  - Normal
  - Doubling w/forgiveness


- **Forgiveness delay** (`forgivedelay`) \<`Float`\>\
When doubling with forgiveness, how many seconds the trigger must go without hurting anything before the damage is reset.

- **Zero Damage Force** (`nodmgforce`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Should the damaged entity receive no physics force from this trigger.

- **Damage Force Override** (`damageforce`) \<`Vector`\>

- **Always think every frame** (`thinkalways`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Normally triggers think every half second, in some cases you may need to request it to damage every frame.  This is expensive!
