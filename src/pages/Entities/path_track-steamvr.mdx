Point Entity

An entity used to build paths for other entities to follow. Each path_track is a node on the path, each holding the name of the next path_track in the path.

<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Parent** (`parentname`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
The name of this entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Entities with parents move with their parent.

- **Parent Model Bone/Attachment Name** (`parentAttachmentName`) \<`ParentAttachment`\>\
The name of the bone or attachment to attach to on the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Use !bonemerge to use bone-merge style attachment.

- **Model Attachment position offset** (`local.origin`) \<`Vector`\>\
Offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Model Attachment angular offset** (`local.angles`) \<`Angle`\>\
Angular offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Model Attachment scale** (`local.scales`) \<`Vector`\>\
Scale in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Use Model Attachment Offset** (`useLocalOffset`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Whether to respect the specified local offset when doing the initial hierarchical attachment to its parent.

- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Spawnflags** (`spawnflags`) \<`Flags`\>
  - Disabled 
  - Fire once 
  - Branch Reverse 
  - Disable train 
  - Teleport to THIS path track 


- **Next Stop Target** (`target`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
The next path_track in the path.

- **Branch Path** (`altpath`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
An alternative path_track to be the next node in the path. Useful for making branching paths. Use the ToggleAlternatePath / EnableAlternatePath inputs to make the alternative path active.

- **New Train Speed** (`speed`) \<`Float`\>\
When the train reaches this path_track, it will set its speed to this speed. This speed must be a positive value that is less than the train's max speed. A value of 0 will cause no change in the train's speed.

- **Path radius** (`radius`) \<`Float`\>\
Used by NPCs who follow track paths (attack chopper/gunship). This tells them the maximum distance they're allowed to be from the path at this node.

- **Orientation Type** (`orientationtype`) \<`Choices`\>\
The way that the path follower faces as it moves through this path track.
  - No change 
  - Face direction of motion 
  - Face this path_track's angles

<summary><h2>Inputs</h2></summary>
- SetParent \<`TargetDestination`\>\
Changes the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy.

- SetParentAttachment \<`String`\>\
Change this entity to attach to a specific attachment point on its parent. Entities must be parented before being sent this input. The parameter passed in should be the name of the attachment.

- SetParentAttachmentMaintainOffset \<`String`\>\
Change this entity to attach to a specific attachment point on it's parent. Entities must be parented before being sent this input. The parameter passed in should be the name of the attachment. The entity will maintain it's position relative to the parent at the time it is attached.

- ClearParent \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity from the the movement hierarchy, leaving it free to move independently.
