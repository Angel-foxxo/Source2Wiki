  - Clients 
  - NPCs 
  - Projectiles 
  - Physics Objects 
  - Only player ally NPCs 
  - Only clients in vehicles 
  - Everything (not including physics debris) 
  - Only clients *not* in vehicles 
  - Physics debris 
  - Only NPCs in vehicles (respects player ally flag) 
  - Correctly account for object mass (trigger_push used to assume 100Kg) and multiple component physobjs (car, blob...) 


- **Filter Name** (`filtername`) \<`FilterClass`\>\

Offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Model Attachment angular offset** (`local.angles`) \<`Angle`\>\
Angular offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Model Attachment scale** (`local.scales`) \<`Vector`\>\
Scale in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Use Model Attachment Offset** (`useLocalOffset`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Whether to respect the specified local offset when doing the initial hierarchical attachment to its parent.

- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

The rate, in seconds, that the trigger updates the OpVar

- **Minimum Value** (`minimum_value`) \<`Float`\>\
The minimum value the opvar will be set to

- **Maximum Value** (`maximum_value`) \<`Float`\>\
The maximum value the opvar will be set to

- **Stack Name** (`stackname`) \<`String`\>\

- **Operator Name** (`operatorname`) \<`String`\>\
The name of the operator the OpVar is in

- **OpVar Name** (`opvarname`) \<`String`\>\
The name of the OpVar to change

- **Volume Center Size** (`centersize`) \<`Float`\>\
The size of the center portion of the trigger volume.

- **Use the trigger in 2D mode** (`is2d`) \<`Boolean`\>\
