Point Entity

A dynamic connection between two navigation nodes. You specify the node IDs of the start and end nodes, and then you can use entity I/O to turn on and off the connection. This could be used to create or destroy a connection in the nodegraph because of some event in your map (a bridge being created/destroyed, etc).
