- EndHint \<`Void`\>\

- SetTargetPlayerToActivator \<`Void`\>\
Set the player that should receive this hint to the activator of this input. Only necessary to use this if the player isn't the activator of the ShowHint input. You shouldn't use !player for this, because that only works in singleplayer, and the point of this is to handle multiple players. Instead, fire this input from an output of the entity that the target player activated to initiate the series of events that caused you to want to show them this hint.
