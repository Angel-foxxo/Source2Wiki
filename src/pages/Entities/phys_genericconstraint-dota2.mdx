<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Spawnflags** (`spawnflags`) \<`Flags`\>
  - No Collision until break\
    
  - Start inactive\

- **Impulse Limit to Break (kg)** (`forcelimit`) \<`Float`\>\
