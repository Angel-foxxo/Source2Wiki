Point Entity

Controller for volumetric fogging - bounds are extents of fog irradiance volume (for indirect)

<details open>
<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Start Disabled** (`StartDisabled`) \<`Boolean`\>

- **Parent** (`parentname`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
The name of this entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Entities with parents move with their parent.

- **Parent Bone/Attachment Name** (`parentAttachmentName`) \<`ParentAttachment`\>\
The name of the bone or attachment to attach to on the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Use !bonemerge to use bone-merge style attachment. NOTE: If this is specified the Hammer transform will be disregarded, even if 'Use Local Transform' is NOT specified (in that case local transform will be identity)

- **Use Local Transform** (`useLocalOffset`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Whether to respect the specified local offset when doing the initial hierarchical attachment to its parent.

- **Local Origin** (`local.origin`) \<`Vector`\>\
Offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Local Angles** (`local.angles`) \<`Angle`\>\
Angular offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Local Scale** (`local.scales`) \<`Vector`\>\
Scale in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Master Fog Controller** (`IsMaster`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Use this as the active fog if there are more than one

- **Fog strength** (`FogStrength`) \<`Float`\>\
Technically the scattering value. Higher values make denser fog.

- **Tint Color** (`TintColor`) \<`Color255`\>\
Tint color for fog.

- **Draw distance** (`DrawDistance`) \<`Float`\>\
Maximum distance to draw fog - WARNING! Changing from default will make fog blockier.

- **Volume Depth** (`volume_depth_override`) \<`Int`\>\
Sets the number of slices in the fog volume.  Increasing from default (128) will increase resolution at the expense of GPU time and memory

- **Resolution at Camera** (`volume_first_slice_thickness`) \<`Float`\>\
Thickness of the first slice in the volume at the camera.  The remaining slices will be warped to maintain this resolution as the draw distance is increased

- **Fade-in start** (`FadeInStart`) \<`Float`\>\
Distance from the eye at which fog starts to fade in.

- **Fade-in end** (`FadeInEnd`) \<`Float`\>\
Distance from the eye at which fog finishes fading in and is at full strength.

- **Fade time** (`FadeSpeed`) \<`Float`\>\
Sets fade in or out time (in seconds).

- **Enable indirect lighting** (`IndirectEnabled`) \<`Boolean`\>

- **Indirect light strength** (`IndirectStrength`) \<`Float`\>

- **Indirect Lighting Dimension** (`IndirectVoxelDim`) \<`Choices`\>
  - Very High Resolution (512x)
  - High Resolution (256x)
  - Medium Resolution (128x)
  - Low Resolution (64x)


- **Noise Speed** (`NoiseSpeed`) \<`Float`\>\
Speed of noise function change

- **Noise Strength** (`NoiseStrength`) \<`Float`\>\
How much noise to add to fog density

- **Noise Scale** (`NoiseScale`) \<`Vector`\>\
Scale of noise (smaller - smoother, larger - more detailed)

- **Wind Speed** (`WindSpeed`) \<`Float`\>

- **Wind Direction** (`WindDirection`) \<`Vector`\>

<summary><h2>Inputs</h2></summary>
- Enable \<`Void`\>\
Enable this entity.

- Disable \<`Void`\>\
Disable this entity.

- SetParent \<`TargetDestination`\>\
Changes the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy.

- SetParentAttachment \<`String`\>\
Change this entity to attach to a specific attachment point on its parent. Entities must be parented before being sent this input. The parameter passed in should be the name of the attachment.

- SetParentAttachmentMaintainOffset \<`String`\>\
Change this entity to attach to a specific attachment point on it's parent. Entities must be parented before being sent this input. The parameter passed in should be the name of the attachment. The entity will maintain it's position relative to the parent at the time it is attached.

- ClearParent \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity from the the movement hierarchy, leaving it free to move independently.

- FollowEntity \<`String`\>\
Bone merges this entity to a parent entity. Call again passing nothing to end the bone merge.

- RunScriptFile \<`String`\>\
Load and execute a script file

- RunScriptCode \<`String`\>\
Execute a fragment of script code

- CallScriptFunction \<`String`\>\
Call a script function

- CallPrivateScriptFunction \<`String`\>\
Calls a script function from this entity's private script scope.

- CallGlobalScriptFunction \<`String`\>\
Calls a script function in the global script scope.

- Kill \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity from the world.

- KillHierarchy \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity and all its children from the world.

- KillConstrained \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity, all its children, and anything constrained to it, from the world.

- AddOutput \<`String`\>\
Adds an entity I/O connection to this entity. Parameter format: outputname&gt;targetname>inputname&gt;parameter&gt;delay&gt;max times to fire (-1 == infinite). Very dangerous, use with care.

- FireUser1 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser1 output to be fired.

- FireUser2 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser2 output to be fired.

- FireUser3 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser3 output to be fired.

- FireUser4 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser4 output to be fired.
