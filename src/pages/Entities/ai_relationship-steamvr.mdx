AI Relationship - Sets relationships between groups of NPCs in the AI.

<details open>
<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Disposition** (`disposition`) \<`Choices`\>\
Choose the way the Subject(s) should feel about the Target(s)
  - Hate\
    
  - Fear\
    
  - Like\
    
  - Neutral\
    


- **Radius for subject** (`radius`) \<`Float`\>

- **Disposition Priority** (`rank`) \<`Integer`\>\
How much the Subject(s) should Like/Hate/Fear the Target(s). Higher priority = stronger feeling.

- **Start Active** (`StartActive`) \<`Boolean`\>

- **Reciprocal** (`Reciprocal`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Set this to YES to have the new relationship mirrored by Target

- **Spawnflags** (`spawnflags`) \<`Flags`\>
  - Notify subject of target's location\
    
  - Notify target of subject's location\
    


- **Subject NPC(s) whose opinion of Target(s) will change** (`subject`) \<`TargetNameOrClass`\>\
This is the NPC(s) whose disposition about the Target(s) will change. May be a targetname or a classname.

- **Target player or NPC(s) about whom Subject(s) will feel differently** (`target`) \<`TargetNameOrClass`\>\
This is the player or NPC(s) about whom the Subject(s) will change their disposition. May be a targetname or a classname.

<summary><h2>Inputs</h2></summary>
- ApplyRelationship \<`Void`\>\
Apply relationship changes. This will change all Subject entities' relationships to all Target entities.

<b>IMPORTANT:</b> Once you ApplyRelationships, this entity is then 'ALWAYS ON' until you send a Disable input or RevertRelationship input. During the time this entity is 'ON', any entities that spawn who match the Subject or Target names will be affected.

<b>IMPORTANT:</b> Unpredictable results may occur when two ai_relationship entities refer to the same set or subset of target or subject entities. This situation should be avoided.

- RevertRelationship \<`Void`\>\
Revert relationship changes. This will return the relationship to what it was at the time the ApplyRelationship input was called (or when this ai_relationship was spawned if StartActive is set).

- RevertToDefaultRelationship \<`Void`\>\
Revert relationship changes to the default relationship, which may have changed since this ai_relationship was applied. This returns control of the entity relationship to the code.
