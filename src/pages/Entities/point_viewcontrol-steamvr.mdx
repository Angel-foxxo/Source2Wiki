Offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Model Attachment angular offset** (`local.angles`) \<`Angle`\>\
Angular offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Model Attachment scale** (`local.scales`) \<`Vector`\>\
Scale in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Use Model Attachment Offset** (`useLocalOffset`) \<`Boolean`\>\

The starting speed that the camera moves at, if it's on a path track.

- **Acceleration units/sec^2** (`acceleration`) \<`String`\>\
The speed at which the camera accelerates to path corner's desired speeds.

- **Stop Deceleration units/sec^2** (`deceleration`) \<`String`\>\
