Point Entity

An entity to create light glows built via the particle editor

<details open>
<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Create Client-Only Entity** (`clientSideEntity`) \<`Choices`\>
  - No 
  - Yes 


- **Parent** (`parentname`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
The name of this entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Entities with parents move with their parent.

- **Parent Model Bone/Attachment Name** (`parentAttachmentName`) \<`ParentAttachment`\>\
The name of the bone or attachment to attach to on the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Use !bonemerge to use bone-merge style attachment.

- **Model Attachment position offset** (`local.origin`) \<`Vector`\>\
Offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Model Attachment angular offset** (`local.angles`) \<`Angle`\>\
Angular offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Model Attachment scale** (`local.scales`) \<`Vector`\>\
Scale in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Use Model Attachment Offset** (`useLocalOffset`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Whether to respect the specified local offset when doing the initial hierarchical attachment to its parent.

- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Particle System Name** (`effect_name`) \<`ParticleSystem`\>

- **Texture Override** (`effect_textureOverride`) \<`Resource`\>\
You can replace the texture of any particle system specified above with a vtex. if empty the default particle behavior will happen.

- **Start Active?** (`start_active`) \<`Boolean`\>

- **Scale** (`scale`) \<`Float`\>\
Scale multiplier of the glow. Used to remap the radius of the particle system. Written to Control Point 17 Y Value

- **Color Tint** (`colortint`) \<`Color255`\>\
Set the light's render color (R G B). Written to Control Point 16

- **Self illum Scalar** (`selfillumscale`) \<`Float`\>\
float value to multiply sprite self illum by. this will affect things like bloom contribution. Written to Control Point 17 Z Value

- **Alpha Scale** (`alphascale`) \<`Float`\>\
Alpha Multiplier on particle system. Written to Control Point 17 X Value

- **Parent (Control Point 0)** (`cpoint0`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
If set, control point 0 of the effect will be at this entity's location. (Otherwise it is at the env_particle_glow origin)

- **Particle Snapshot File** (`snapshot_file`) \<`Resource`\>\
Name of .vsnap (Particle Snapshot File) to be loaded and used by this particle system (e.g. 'smoke_snapshot1.vsnap')

- **Particle Snapshot Node** (`snapshot_mesh`) \<`NodeId`\>\
Spawns a glow particle at each mesh vertex. Id of a node in the map to be used to generate a particle snapshot, if specified Particle Snapshot File is ignored. A Particle system that is setup for snapshots must be used. eg : glow01_snapshot.vpcf

<summary><h2>Inputs</h2></summary>
- SetParent \<`TargetDestination`\>\
Changes the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy.

- SetParentAttachment \<`String`\>\
Change this entity to attach to a specific attachment point on its parent. Entities must be parented before being sent this input. The parameter passed in should be the name of the attachment.

- SetParentAttachmentMaintainOffset \<`String`\>\
Change this entity to attach to a specific attachment point on it's parent. Entities must be parented before being sent this input. The parameter passed in should be the name of the attachment. The entity will maintain it's position relative to the parent at the time it is attached.

- ClearParent \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity from the the movement hierarchy, leaving it free to move independently.

- FollowEntity \<`String`\>\
