Point Entity

A physically simulated spring. 'Length' is what's known as the 'natural spring length'. This is how long the spring would be if it was at rest (nothing hanging on it or attached). When you attach something to the spring, it will stretch longer than its 'natural length'. The amount of stretch is determined by the 'Sprint Frequency'. The larger the spring frequency the less stretch the spring.

<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Spawnflags** (`spawnflags`) \<`Flags`\>
  - Force only on stretch\
    


- **Entity 1** (`attach1`) \<`TargetDestination`\>

- **Entity 2** (`attach2`) \<`TargetDestination`\>

- **Spring Axis** (`springaxis`) \<`Vecline`\>\
Use the helper. Drag it out to match the virtual spring.

- **Length** (`length`) \<`String`\>\
How long the spring would be if it was at rest (nothing hanging on it or attached). 0 means the length of the helpr .

- **Frequency** (`frequency`) \<`String`\>\
The stiffness of the spring.  The larger the number the less the spring will stretch. The maximum should be not more than 30!

- **Damping Ratio** (`damping`) \<`String`\>\
How much energy the spring loses. Values less than one give you an osscilating spring. A value of one makes the spring return without overshooting
