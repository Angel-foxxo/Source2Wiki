Point Entity

An entity that fires a timer event at regular, or random, intervals. It can also be set to oscillate betweena high and low end, in which case it will fire alternating high/low outputs each time it fires.

<details open>
<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Start Disabled** (`StartDisabled`) \<`Boolean`\>

- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Spawnflags** (`spawnflags`) \<`Flags`\>
  - Oscillator (alternates between OnTimerHigh and OnTimerLow outputs)


- **Use Random Time** (`UseRandomTime`) \<`Boolean`\>

- **Pause After Firing** (`PauseAfterFiring`) \<`Boolean`\>

- **Minimum Random Interval** (`LowerRandomBound`) \<`Float`\>\
If 'Use Random Time' is set, this is the minimum time between timer fires. The time will be a random number between this and the 'Maximum Random Interval'.

- **Maximum Random Interval** (`UpperRandomBound`) \<`Float`\>\
If 'Use Random Time' is set, this is the maximum time between timer fires. The time will be a random number between the 'Minimum Random Interval' and this.

- **Refire Interval** (`RefireTime`) \<`Float`\>\
If 'Use Random Time' isn't set, this is the time between timer fires, in seconds.

- **Initial delay before first fire** (`InitialDelay`) \<`Float`\>\
Time to wait after the timer is enabled before firing the first time. Negative values can be used to avoid waiting the lower random bound on spawn, or positive values to postpone the first event.
