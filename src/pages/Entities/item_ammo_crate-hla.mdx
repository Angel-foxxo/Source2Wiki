Point Entity

Ammo Crate

<details open>
<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Start Fade Dist** (`fademindist`) \<`Float`\>\
Distance at which the prop starts to fade (&lt;0 = subtract from fademaxdist).

- **End Fade Dist** (`fademaxdist`) \<`Float`\>\
Max fade distance at which the prop is visible (0 = don't fade out)

- **Fade Scale** (`fadescale`) \<`Float`\>\
If you specify a fade in the worldspawn, or if the engine is running under low end/medium end/XBox360, then the engine will forcibly fade out props even if fademindist/fademaxdist isn't specified. This scale factor gives you some control over the fade. Using 0 here turns off the forcible fades. Numbers smaller than 1 cause the prop to fade out at further distances, and greater than 1 cause it to fade out at closer distances.

- **Color (R G B)** (`rendercolor`) \<`Color255`\>

- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Ammo Type** (`AmmoType`) \<`Choices`\>
  - Pistol
  - SMG1
  - AR2
  - RPG Rounds
  - Buckshot
  - Grenades
  - 357
  - XBowBolt
  - AR2 Alt-Fire Round
  - SMG Alt-Fire grenade
