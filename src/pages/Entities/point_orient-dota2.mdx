<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Create Client-Only Entity** (`clientSideEntity`) \<`Choices`\>
  - No\

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Parent** (`parentname`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
The name of this entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Entities with parents move with their parent.

- **Parent Bone/Attachment Name** (`parentAttachmentName`) \<`ParentAttachment`\>\
The name of the bone or attachment to attach to on the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Use !bonemerge to use bone-merge style attachment. NOTE: If this is specified the Hammer transform will be disregarded, even if 'Use Local Transform' is NOT specified (in that case local transform will be identity)

- **Use Local Transform** (`useLocalOffset`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Whether to respect the specified local offset when doing the initial hierarchical attachment to its parent.

- **Local Origin** (`local.origin`) \<`Vector`\>\
Offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Local Angles** (`local.angles`) \<`Angle`\>\
Angular offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Local Scale** (`local.scales`) \<`Vector`\>\
Scale in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Orient Towards** (`orient_towards`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
Which entity should I orient towards?

- **Goal Direction Type** (`goal_direction_type`) \<`Choices`\>\
How to determine what the goal forward direction is
  - Point At Origin\
    
  - Point At Center\
    
  - Point At Head\
    
  - Align To Forward Direction\
    
  - Align To Look Direction\
    


- **Orientation Constraints** (`constraint_type`) \<`Choices`\>\
Should the orientation be constrained?
  - No constraints\
    
  - Preserve Up Axis\
    


- **Maximum Turn Rate** (`max_turn_rate`) \<`Float`\>\
Max turn rate, 0 means instantaneously point toward the target

- **Initial State** (`start_active`) \<`Choices`\>
  - Inactive\
    
  - Active\

Removes this entity from the world.

- KillHierarchy \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity and all its children from the world.

- KillConstrained \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity, all its children, and anything constrained to it, from the world.

- AddOutput \<`String`\>\
Adds an entity I/O connection to this entity. Parameter format: outputname&gt;targetname>inputname&gt;parameter&gt;delay&gt;max times to fire (-1 == infinite). Very dangerous, use with care.

- FireUser1 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser1 output to be fired.

- FireUser2 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser2 output to be fired.

- FireUser3 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser3 output to be fired.

- FireUser4 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser4 output to be fired.

- SetParent \<`TargetDestination`\>\
Changes the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy.

- SetParentAttachment \<`String`\>\
Change this entity to attach to a specific attachment point on its parent. Entities must be parented before being sent this input. The parameter passed in should be the name of the attachment.

- SetParentAttachmentMaintainOffset \<`String`\>\
Change this entity to attach to a specific attachment point on it's parent. Entities must be parented before being sent this input. The parameter passed in should be the name of the attachment. The entity will maintain it's position relative to the parent at the time it is attached.

- ClearParent \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity from the the movement hierarchy, leaving it free to move independently.
