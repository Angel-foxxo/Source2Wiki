Mesh Entity

A portal brush used to manage visibility in maps. Portals define areas, which are spaces that are connected in the map. Both sides of a portal cannot touch the same area, for example, a doughnut shaped map would require at least two portals to divide the map into two areas. A linear map could be divided into two areas with a single area portal.
