<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Parent** (`parentname`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
The name of this entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Entities with parents move with their parent.

- **Parent Bone/Attachment Name** (`parentAttachmentName`) \<`ParentAttachment`\>\
The name of the bone or attachment to attach to on the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Use !bonemerge to use bone-merge style attachment. NOTE: If this is specified the Hammer transform will be disregarded, even if 'Use Local Transform' is NOT specified (in that case local transform will be identity)

- **Use Local Transform** (`useLocalOffset`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Whether to respect the specified local offset when doing the initial hierarchical attachment to its parent.

- **Local Origin** (`local.origin`) \<`Vector`\>\
Offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Local Angles** (`local.angles`) \<`Angle`\>\
Angular offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Local Scale** (`local.scales`) \<`Vector`\>\
Scale in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Entity to point at** (`target`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
The name of an entity in the map that the dynamic light will point at.

- **Light color** (`_light`) \<`Color255`\>

- **Light brightness** (`brightness`) \<`Integer`\>

- **Inner (bright) angle** (`_inner_cone`) \<`Integer`\>

- **Outer (fading) angle** (`_cone`) \<`Integer`\>

- **Maximum distance** (`distance`) \<`Float`\>\
This is the distance that light is allowed to cast, in inches.

- **Spotlight end radius** (`spotlight_radius`) \<`Float`\>\
This is the radius of the light, in inches, at the object that it is hitting.

- **Appearance** (`style`) \<`Choices`\>
  - Normal 
  - Fluorescent flicker 
  - Slow, strong pulse 
  - Slow pulse, noblack 
  - Gentle pulse 
  - Flicker A 
  - Flicker B 
  - Candle A 
  - Candle B 
  - Candle C 
  - Fast strobe 
  - Slow strobe 


- **Spawnflags** (`spawnflags`) \<`Flags`\>
  - Do not light world (better perf) 
  - Do not light models 
  - Add Displacement Alpha 
  - Subtract Displacement Alpha

<summary><h2>Inputs</h2></summary>
- SetParent \<`TargetDestination`\>\
Changes the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy.

- SetParentAttachmentMaintainOffset \<`String`\>\
Change this entity to attach to a specific attachment point on it's parent. Entities must be parented before being sent this input. The parameter passed in should be the name of the attachment. The entity will maintain it's position relative to the parent at the time it is attached.

- ClearParent \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity from the the movement hierarchy, leaving it free to move independently.

- FollowEntity \<`String`\>\
Bone merges this entity to a parent entity. Call again passing nothing to end the bone merge.
