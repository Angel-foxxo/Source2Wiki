Point Entity

An entity that creates an explosion at its origin. If the no-damage spawnflag is set, the explosion won't be visible, but will apply force to any physics objects within its radius.

<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Parent** (`parentname`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
The name of this entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Entities with parents move with their parent.

- **Parent Model Bone/Attachment Name** (`parentAttachmentName`) \<`ParentAttachment`\>\
The name of the bone or attachment to attach to on the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Use !bonemerge to use bone-merge style attachment.

- **Model Attachment position offset** (`local.origin`) \<`Vector`\>\
Offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Model Attachment angular offset** (`local.angles`) \<`Angle`\>\
Angular offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Model Attachment scale** (`local.scales`) \<`Vector`\>\
Scale in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Use Model Attachment Offset** (`useLocalOffset`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Whether to respect the specified local offset when doing the initial hierarchical attachment to its parent.

- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Magnitude** (`magnitude`) \<`String`\>\
Amount of physics force applied by the explosion.

- **Clamp Radius (0 = auto)** (`radius`) \<`String`\>\
If specified, the radius in which the explosion damages entities. If unspecified, the radius will be based on the magnitude.

- **Limit to Entity** (`targetentityname`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
If specified, the explosion will only affect the matching entity.

- **Explode on spawn** (`explodeonspawn`) \<`Boolean`\>

- **Spawnflags** (`spawnflags`) \<`Flags`\>
  - No Damage - Only Force\
    
  - Push players\
    
  - Push radially - not as a sphere\
    
  - Test LOS before pushing\
    
  - Disorient player if pushed\
    


- **Inner radius** (`inner_radius`) \<`Float`\>\
If not zero, the LOS is calculated from a point intersecting this sphere.

- **Physics push scale** (`pushscale`) \<`Float`\>\
Scale the applied physics force by this value.

- **Convert physics props to debris when possible** (`ConvertToDebrisWhenPossible`) \<`Choices`\>
  - No\
    
  - Yes\

<summary><h2>Inputs</h2></summary>
- SetParent \<`TargetDestination`\>\
Changes the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy.

- SetParentAttachment \<`String`\>\
Change this entity to attach to a specific attachment point on its parent. Entities must be parented before being sent this input. The parameter passed in should be the name of the attachment.

- SetParentAttachmentMaintainOffset \<`String`\>\
Change this entity to attach to a specific attachment point on it's parent. Entities must be parented before being sent this input. The parameter passed in should be the name of the attachment. The entity will maintain it's position relative to the parent at the time it is attached.

- ClearParent \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity from the the movement hierarchy, leaving it free to move independently.

- RunScriptFile \<`String`\>\
Load and execute a script file

- RunScriptCode \<`String`\>\
Execute a fragment of script code

- CallScriptFunction \<`String`\>\
Call a script function

- CallPrivateScriptFunction \<`String`\>\
Calls a script function from this entity's private script scope.

- CallGlobalScriptFunction \<`String`\>\
Calls a script function in the global script scope.

- Kill \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity from the world.

- KillHierarchy \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity and all its children from the world.

- AddOutput \<`String`\>\
Adds an entity I/O connection to this entity. Parameter format: outputname&gt;targetname>inputname&gt;parameter&gt;delay&gt;max times to fire (-1 == infinite). Very dangerous, use with care.

- FireUser1 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser1 output to be fired.

- FireUser2 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser2 output to be fired.

- FireUser3 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser3 output to be fired.

- FireUser4 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser4 output to be fired.

- Explode \<`Void`\>\
Trigger the explosion.
