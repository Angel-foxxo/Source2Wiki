Point Entity

A message forwarder. Fires an OnTrigger output when triggered, and can be disabled to prevent forwarding outputs.

Useful as an intermediary between one entity and another for turning on or off an I/O connection, or as a container for holding a set of outputs that can be triggered from multiple places.

Without this, the logic_relay will wait until all inputs connected to OnTrigger() have fired before retriggering

- **Pass through caller** (`PassthroughCaller`) \<`Boolean`\>\
If set, this logic_relay will be ignored by !caller in downstream IO connections. Instead, the previous caller in the IO chain will be found by !caller.
