Point Entity

A physically simulated hinge. Use the helper to define the axis of rotation.

<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Minimum Sound Velocity** (`minSoundThreshold`) \<`Float`\>\
When travelling below this many units/sec, will not play any sound.

- **Full Sound Velocity** (`maxSoundThreshold`) \<`Float`\>\
When travelling at this speed or above, will play sound at full volume.

- **Travel sound (forward)** (`slidesoundfwd`) \<`Sound`\>\
Play this sound when travelling forward on helper axis

- **Travel sound (backward)** (`slidesoundback`) \<`Sound`\>\
Play this sound when travelling backward on helper axis

- **Reversal sound threshold (small)** (`reversalsoundthresholdSmall`) \<`Float`\>\
When accelerating by more than this many units/sec^2 opposite to direction of travel, play the small reversal sound.

- **Reversal sound threshold (medium)** (`reversalsoundthresholdMedium`) \<`Float`\>\
When accelerating by more than this many units/sec^2 opposite to direction of travel, play the medium reversal sound.

- **Reversal sound threshold (large)** (`reversalsoundthresholdLarge`) \<`Float`\>\
When accelerating by more than this many units/sec^2 opposite to direction of travel, play the large reversal sound.

- **Reversal sound (small)** (`reversalsoundSmall`) \<`Sound`\>\
Play this sound when making a hard reverse over the small threshold but less than medium

- **Reversal sound (medium)** (`reversalsoundMedium`) \<`Sound`\>\
Play this sound when making a hard reverse over the medium threshold but less than large

- **Reversal sound (large)** (`reversalsoundLarge`) \<`Sound`\>\
Play this sound when making a hard reverse over the large threshold

- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Spawnflags** (`spawnflags`) \<`Flags`\>
  - No Collision until break 
  - Start inactive 
  - Change mass to keep stable attachment to world 
  - Do not connect entities until turned on 


- **Entity 1** (`attach1`) \<`TargetDestination`\>

- **Entity 2** (`attach2`) \<`TargetDestination`\>

- **Impulse Limit to Break (kg)** (`forcelimit`) \<`Float`\>\
The amount of impulse an impact must apply to the constraint to break it. A way of calculating this is to set it to the mass of an object that would break this constraint if it were resting on the constrainted objects.

- **Angular Impulse Limit to Break (kg * distance)** (`torquelimit`) \<`Float`\>\
The amount of angular impulse required to break the constraint. A way of calculating this is to multiply any reference mass by the resting distance (from the center of mass of the object) needed to break the constraint.

- **Play Sound on Break** (`breaksound`) \<`Sound`\>\
A sound played when the constraint is broken.

- **Follow teleport distance** (`teleportfollowdistance`) \<`Float`\>\
If one object teleports more than this many units away it will cause the other constrained object to teleport to an appropriate relative position.

- **Friction** (`hingefriction`) \<`Float`\>\
Resistance/friction in the hinge

- **Min Rotation Limit** (`min_rotation`) \<`Float`\>\
Minimum rotation limit around hinge axis

- **Max Rotation Limit** (`max_rotation`) \<`Float`\>\
Maximum rotation limit around hinge axis

- **Initial rotation** (`initial_rotation`) \<`Float`\>\
Initial rotation of the hinge (values -1 to 1 where -1 mean open at minimum limit and 1 means open at maximum limit)

- **Local Space Hinge Axis** (`hingeaxis`) \<`LocalAxis`\>

- **Motor frequency** (`motorfrequency`) \<`Float`\>\
Range 0 - 30 (only used when driving the relative angle through the angle input)

- **Motor damping ratio** (`motordampingratio`) \<`Float`\>\
Range 0 - 1 (only used when driving the relative angle through the angle input)

- **Load Scale** (`SystemLoadScale`) \<`Float`\>\
Scale of the load connected to this hinge (1=just the objects directly connected)

- **Threshold for move events** (`AngleSpeedThreshold`) \<`Float`\>

<summary><h2>Inputs</h2></summary>
- RunScriptFile \<`String`\>\
Load and execute a script file

- RunScriptCode \<`String`\>\
Execute a fragment of script code

- CallScriptFunction \<`String`\>\
Call a script function

- CallPrivateScriptFunction \<`String`\>\
Calls a script function from this entity's private script scope.

- CallGlobalScriptFunction \<`String`\>\
Calls a script function in the global script scope.

- Kill \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity from the world.

- KillHierarchy \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity and all its children from the world.

- AddOutput \<`String`\>\
Adds an entity I/O connection to this entity. Parameter format: outputname&gt;targetname>inputname&gt;parameter&gt;delay&gt;max times to fire (-1 == infinite). Very dangerous, use with care.

- FireUser1 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser1 output to be fired.

- FireUser2 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser2 output to be fired.

- FireUser3 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser3 output to be fired.

- FireUser4 \<`Void`\>\
Causes this entity's OnUser4 output to be fired.

- Break \<`Void`\>\
Force the constraint to break.

- TurnOn \<`Void`\>\
Enable the constraint.  Do this when the objects don't exist when the constraint spawns - or when you have deactivated the constraint.  Broken constraints can NOT be turned on.  They have been deleted.

- TurnOff \<`Void`\>\
Disable this constraint.

- SetAngularVelocity \<`Float`\>\
Set angular velocity around the hinge (motor) in deg/sec

- SetHingeFriction \<`Float`\>\
Set Motor Friction, 0 = no friction, 1 = friction that is about enough to counter gravity

- SetMinLimit \<`Float`\>\
Set the minimum hinge angle (degrees)

- SetMaxLimit \<`Float`\>\
Set the maximum hinge angle (degrees)

- SetMotorTargetVelocity \<`Float`\>\
Set Motor target velocity in deg/sec, use 0 to just turn friction on

- SetMotorTargetAngle \<`Float`\>\
Set Motor target angle, degrees. Exact number depends on constrained bodies reference frames and initial configuration. See constraint limits for reference to sensible range of values.
