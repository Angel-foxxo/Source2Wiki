Point Entity



<details open>
<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **World Model** (`model`) \<`Resource`\>

- **Collisions** (`solid`) \<`Choices`\>
  - Not Solid 
  - Use axis-aligned box 
  - Use oriented Box 
  - Use VPhysics 


- **Disable Shadows** (`disableshadows`) \<`Boolean`\>

- **Screen Space Fade** (`screenspacefade`) \<`Boolean`\>\
The method by which the fading distance should be determined. If 'No', the fade distances is the distance from the player's view to the object, in inches. If 'Yes', the fade distance is the size of the object onscreen, in pixels.

- **Skin** (`skin`) \<`MaterialGroup`\>\
Some models have multiple versions of their textures, called skins.

- **LOD Level** (`lodlevel`) \<`LodLevel`\>\
LOD level to be displayed in game. Set to Auto for standard automatic selection, or set to a specific level to always use that level.

- **Start Fade Dist/Pixels** (`fademindist`) \<`Float`\>\
Distance at which the prop starts to fade (&lt;0 = use fademaxdist). If 'Screen Space Fade' is selected, this represents the number of pixels wide covered by the prop when it starts to fade.

- **End Fade Dist/Pixels** (`fademaxdist`) \<`Float`\>\
Maximum distance at which the prop is visible (0 = don't fade out). If 'Screen Space Fade' is selected, this represents the *minimum* number of pixels wide covered by the prop when it fades.

- **Fade Scale** (`fadescale`) \<`Float`\>\
If you specify a fade in the worldspawn, or if the engine is running under dx7 [hl2/ep1/portal] or dx8 [ep2/tf], then the engine will forcibly fade out props even if fademindist/fademaxdist isn't specified. This scale factor gives you some control over the fade. Using 0 here turns off the forcible fades. Numbers smaller than 1 cause the prop to fade out at further distances,and greater than 1 cause it to fade out at closer distances.

- **Detail Geometry** (`detailgeometry`) \<`Boolean`\>\
If true this geometry is not important for precomputed lighting

- **Vis Occluder** (`visoccluder`) \<`Boolean`\>\
If true this geometry is used as an occluder for precomputed visibility

- **Bake To World** (`baketoworld`) \<`Boolean`\>\
If true this geometry will be baked into the world geometry of the map so that the model is not referenced at runtime.

- **Alpha** (`renderamt`) \<`Integer`\>\
Alpha of the fade, where 0 = fully transparent and 255 = fully opaque.

- **Color (R G B)** (`rendercolor`) \<`Color255`\>

- **Lighting Origin** (`lightingorigin`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
Select a an entity to specify a location to sample lighting from, instead of using this entity's bounding box center.

- **Light Group** (`lightgroup`) \<`String`\>\
Will only be lit by lights affecting this group.

- **Render to Cubemaps** (`rendertocubemaps`) \<`Boolean`\>\
If true, this geometry renders into baked cube maps

- **Precompute Light Probes** (`precomputelightprobes`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Pre-compute environment map and light probe volume used on this object.

- **Override Material** (`materialoverride`) \<`Material`\>

- **Disable in low quality mode** (`disableinlowquality`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Do not render this prop when using the lowest quality video settings, it is an non-essential detail.

- **Lightmap Scale Bias** (`lightmapscalebias`) \<`Choices`\>\
Use to scale the resolution of the lightmap for this object.
  - Scale down by 256 
  - Scale down by 128 
  - Scale down by 64 
  - Scale down by 32 
  - Scale down by 16 
  - Scale down by 8 
  - Scale down by 4 
  - Scale down by 2 
  - Default (no scale) 
  - Scale up by 2 
  - Scale up by 4 
  - Scale up by 8 
  - Scale up by 16 
  - Scale up by 32 
  - Scale up by 64 
  - Scale up by 128 
  - Scale up by 256 


- **Bake Lighting** (`bakelighting`) \<`Choices`\>
  - Default 
  - No 
  - Yes 


- **Render with Dynamic Objects** (`renderwithdynamic`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Render this object with other dynamic objects
