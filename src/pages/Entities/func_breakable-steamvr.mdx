- **FX Amount (0 - 255)** (`renderamt`) \<`Integer`\>\
The FX amount is used by the selected Render Mode.

- **FX Color (R G B)** (`rendercolor`) \<`Color255`\>\
The FX color is used by the selected Render Mode.

- **Disable Receiving Shadows** (`disablereceiveshadows`) \<`Boolean`\>

- **Light Group** (`lightgroup`) \<`String`\>\

Distance at which the overlay starts to fade (&lt;0 = subtract from fademaxdist).

- **Fade Scale** (`fadescale`) \<`Float`\>\
If you specify a fade in the worldspawn, or if the engine is running under low end/medium end/XBox360, then the engine will forcibly fade out props even if fademindist/fademaxdist isn't specified. This scale factor gives you some control over the fade. Using 0 here turns off the forcible fades. Numbers smaller than 1 cause the prop to fade out at further distances, and greater than 1 cause it to fade out at closer distances.

- **Parent Model Bone/Attachment Name** (`parentAttachmentName`) \<`ParentAttachment`\>\
