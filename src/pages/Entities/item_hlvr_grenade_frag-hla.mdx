Point Entity



<details open>
<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Damage Filter** (`damagefilter`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
Name of the filter entity that controls which entities can damage us.

- **Disable shadows** (`disableshadows`) \<`Boolean`\>

- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Start Fade Dist/Pixels** (`fademindist`) \<`Float`\>\
Distance at which the prop starts to fade (&lt;0 = use fademaxdist). If 'Screen Space Fade' is selected, this represents the number of pixels wide covered by the prop when it starts to fade.

- **End Fade Dist/Pixels** (`fademaxdist`) \<`Float`\>\
Maximum distance at which the prop is visible (0 = don't fade out). If 'Screen Space Fade' is selected, this represents the *minimum* number of pixels wide covered by the prop when it fades.

- **Fade Scale** (`fadescale`) \<`Float`\>\
If you specify a fade in the worldspawn, or if the engine is running under dx7, then the engine will forcibly fade out props even if fademindist/fademaxdist isn't specified. This scale factor gives you some control over the fade. Using 0 here turns off the forcible fades.

- **Start Asleep** (`phys_start_asleep`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Should the physics of the item be initialized as sleeping on spawn

- **Spawnflags** (`spawnflags`) \<`Flags`\>
  - Start Constrained\
