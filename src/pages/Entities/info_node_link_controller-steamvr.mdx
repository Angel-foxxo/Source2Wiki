Point Entity

An entity that controls all connections between nodes that intersect the controller's volume. This allows for mass enabling/disabling of all node connections through a volume.

  - Off - navigation between the nodes is disabled
  - On - navigation between the nodes is enabled


- **Allow Pass When Off** (`AllowUse`) \<`String`\>\
Entity or class to allow passage even when node is off.
