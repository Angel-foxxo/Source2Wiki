Point Entity

Antlion grub

<details open>
<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Global Entity Name** (`globalname`) \<`String`\>\
Name by which this entity is linked to another entity in a different map. When the player transitions to a new map, entities in the new map with globalnames matching entities in the previous map will have the previous map's state copied over their state.

- **Start Fade Dist** (`fademindist`) \<`Float`\>\
Distance at which the prop starts to fade (&lt;0 = subtract from fademaxdist).

- **End Fade Dist** (`fademaxdist`) \<`Float`\>\
Max fade distance at which the prop is visible (0 = don't fade out)

- **Fade Scale** (`fadescale`) \<`Float`\>\
If you specify a fade in the worldspawn, or if the engine is running under low end/medium end/XBox360, then the engine will forcibly fade out props even if fademindist/fademaxdist isn't specified. This scale factor gives you some control over the fade. Using 0 here turns off the forcible fades. Numbers smaller than 1 cause the prop to fade out at further distances, and greater than 1 cause it to fade out at closer distances.

- **Color (R G B)** (`rendercolor`) \<`Color255`\>

- **Entity Scripts** (`vscripts`) \<`ScriptList`\>\
Name(s) of script files that are executed after all entities have spawned.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Spawnflags** (`spawnflags`) \<`Flags`\>
  - Do not automatically attach to surface
