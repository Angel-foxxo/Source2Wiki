<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Start Disabled** (`StartDisabled`) \<`Boolean`\>

- **Start Fade Dist** (`fademindist`) \<`Float`\>\
Distance at which the prop starts to fade (&lt;0 = subtract from fademaxdist).

- **End Fade Dist** (`fademaxdist`) \<`Float`\>\
Max fade distance at which the prop is visible (0 = don't fade out)

- **Fade Scale** (`fadescale`) \<`Float`\>\
If you specify a fade in the worldspawn, or if the engine is running under low end/medium end/XBox360, then the engine will forcibly fade out props even if fademindist/fademaxdist isn't specified. This scale factor gives you some control over the fade. Using 0 here turns off the forcible fades. Numbers smaller than 1 cause the prop to fade out at further distances, and greater than 1 cause it to fade out at closer distances.
