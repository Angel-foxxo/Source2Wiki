Point Entity

An entity that spits out a constant stream of smoke. See particlezoo.vmf for sample usage. You can place up to two env_particlelight entities near the smoke stack to add ambient light to its particles.

<summary><h2>Keyvalues</h2></summary>
- **Parent** (`parentname`) \<`TargetDestination`\>\
The name of this entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Entities with parents move with their parent.

- **Parent Model Bone/Attachment Name** (`parentAttachmentName`) \<`ParentAttachment`\>\
The name of the bone or attachment to attach to on the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy. Use !bonemerge to use bone-merge style attachment.

- **Model Attachment position offset** (`local.origin`) \<`Vector`\>\
Offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Model Attachment angular offset** (`local.angles`) \<`Angle`\>\
Angular offset in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Model Attachment scale** (`local.scales`) \<`Vector`\>\
Scale in the local space of the parent model's attachment/bone to use in hierarchy. Not used if you are not using parent attachment.

- **Use Model Attachment Offset** (`useLocalOffset`) \<`Boolean`\>\
Whether to respect the specified local offset when doing the initial hierarchical attachment to its parent.

- **Name** (`targetname`) \<`TargetSource`\>\
The name that other entities refer to this entity by.

- **Initial State** (`InitialState`) \<`Choices`\>
  - Off 
  - On 


- **Spread at the base** (`BaseSpread`) \<`Integer`\>\
Amount of random spread in the origins of the smoke particles when they're spawned.

- **Spread Speed** (`SpreadSpeed`) \<`Integer`\>\
Amount of random spread in the velocity of the smoke particles after they're spawned.

- **Speed** (`Speed`) \<`Integer`\>\
The speed at which the smoke particles move after they're spawned.

- **Particle start size** (`StartSize`) \<`Integer`\>\
Size of the smoke particles when they're first emitted.

- **Particle end size** (`EndSize`) \<`Integer`\>\
Size of the smoke particles at the point they fade out completely.

- **Emission rate** (`Rate`) \<`Integer`\>\
Rate at which to emit smoke particles (i.e. particles to emit per second).

- **Length of smoke trail** (`JetLength`) \<`Integer`\>\
Length of the smokestack. Lifetime of the smoke particles is derived from this & particle speed.

- **Wind X/Y Angle** (`WindAngle`) \<`Integer`\>\
This specifies the wind direction. It is an angle in the XY plane. WindSpeed specifies the strength of the wind.

- **Wind Speed** (`WindSpeed`) \<`Integer`\>\
The strength of the wind.

- **Particle material** (`SmokeMaterial`) \<`String`\>\
Material of the smoke particles emitted by this stack.

- **Twist** (`twist`) \<`Integer`\>\
The amount, in degrees per second, that the smoke particles twist around the origin.

- **Roll Speed** (`roll`) \<`Float`\>\
Amount of roll in degrees per second.

- **Base Color (R G B)** (`rendercolor`) \<`Color255`\>

- **Translucency** (`renderamt`) \<`Integer`\>

<summary><h2>Inputs</h2></summary>
- SetParent \<`TargetDestination`\>\
Changes the entity's parent in the movement hierarchy.

- SetParentAttachment \<`String`\>\
Change this entity to attach to a specific attachment point on its parent. Entities must be parented before being sent this input. The parameter passed in should be the name of the attachment.

- SetParentAttachmentMaintainOffset \<`String`\>\
Change this entity to attach to a specific attachment point on it's parent. Entities must be parented before being sent this input. The parameter passed in should be the name of the attachment. The entity will maintain it's position relative to the parent at the time it is attached.

- ClearParent \<`Void`\>\
Removes this entity from the the movement hierarchy, leaving it free to move independently.

- TurnOn \<`Void`\>\
Turn on the smokestack.

- TurnOff \<`Void`\>\
Turn off the smokestack.

- Toggle \<`Void`\>\
Toggles the smokestack between on and off state.

- JetLength \<`Integer`\>\
Set the length of the smoke trail.

- Rate \<`Integer`\>\
Set the rate at which to emit smoke particles (particles per second).

- Speed \<`Integer`\>\
Set the speed at which the smoke particles move after they're spawned.

- SpreadSpeed \<`Integer`\>\
Set the amount of random spread in the velocity of the smoke particles after they're spawned.
